# GAP (Generic Access Profile) Implementation

This module provides an implementation of the Bluetooth Generic Access Profile (GAP), which defines how Bluetooth devices interact with each other at a fundamental level, handling device discovery, connection establishment, and basic security.

## Overview

The GAP implementation is organized into the following components:

- **types.rs**: Core data structures for GAP operations
- **constants.rs**: Constants used in GAP operations
- **adapter.rs**: Main implementation of GAP functionality

## Components

### GAP Types (types.rs)

Defines the fundamental data structures used in GAP operations:

- **Role**: Device roles (Central, Peripheral, Observer, Broadcaster)
- **DiscoveryMode**: Device discoverability modes
- **ConnectionMode**: Device connectability modes
- **AuthenticationMode**: Security modes
- **AddressType**: Bluetooth address types
- **BdAddr**: Bluetooth device address structure
- **Device**: Representation of a discovered Bluetooth device

```rust
// Example: Working with Bluetooth addresses
let addr = BdAddr::new([0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06]);
println!("Device address: {}", addr); // Prints: 06:05:04:03:02:01
```

### GAP Constants (constants.rs)

Defines constants used throughout the GAP implementation:

- Address types
- HCI command opcodes
- HCI event codes
- Scan parameters
- Connection parameters
- Advertising data types

### GAP Adapter (adapter.rs)

The `GapAdapter` provides the main functionality for GAP operations:

- Device discovery (scanning)
- Connection management
- Local device configuration
- Event processing

```rust
// Example: Setting up device discovery
let mut adapter = GapAdapter::new(0)?;
let callback = Box::new(|device: &Device| {
    println!("Discovered device: {}", device.address);
    if let Some(name) = &device.name {
        println!("  Name: {}", name);
    }
});

adapter.start_discovery(callback)?;
adapter.process_events(Some(Duration::from_secs(10)))?;
adapter.stop_discovery()?;
```

## Current Capabilities

- Device discovery (LE scanning)
- Device connection and disconnection
- Device property parsing from advertising data
- Callback-based discovery notifications
- Local device configuration (name, address)
- Event processing

## Limitations & Future Work

1. **Security Management**: Authentication, encryption, and pairing procedures are not fully implemented.

2. **Bonding**: Persistent storage of bonding information is not implemented.

3. **Multiple Adapter Support**: Better support for managing multiple adapters.

4. **Classic Bluetooth Support**: Current implementation focuses on Bluetooth LE; classic Bluetooth discovery and connection need expansion.

5. **Extended Advertising**: Support for Bluetooth 5.0+ extended advertising features.

6. **Privacy Features**: Address rotation and privacy features are not implemented.

7. **Connection Parameter Updates**: Support for negotiating and updating connection parameters.

8. **LE Features Discovery**: Discovery of supported LE features is not implemented.

9. **Power Management**: Features related to power management are not fully supported.

10. **Dual-Mode Device Handling**: Special handling for dual-mode (BR/EDR + LE) devices.

## Usage Examples

### Device Discovery

```rust
// Create a GAP adapter
let mut adapter = GapAdapter::new(0)?;

// Get the local device name and address
let name = adapter.get_local_name()?;
let address = adapter.get_local_address()?;
println!("Local device: {} ({})", name, address);

// Set up discovery callback
let callback = Box::new(|device: &Device| {
    println!("Discovered device: {}", device.address);
    if let Some(name) = &device.name {
        println!("  Name: {}", name);
    }
    if let Some(rssi) = device.rssi {
        println!("  RSSI: {} dBm", rssi);
    }
});

// Start discovery
println!("Starting device discovery...");
adapter.start_discovery(callback)?;

// Process events for 10 seconds
for i in 0..10 {
    println!("Scanning... {}/10", i + 1);
    adapter.process_events(Some(Duration::from_secs(1)))?;
}

// Stop discovery
adapter.stop_discovery()?;
```

### Connection Management

```rust
// Connect to a device
let addr = BdAddr::new([0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06]);
adapter.connect(&addr, AddressType::Public)?;

// Process events to handle connection establishment
adapter.process_events(Some(Duration::from_secs(5)))?;

// Disconnect
if let Some(handle) = current_connection_handle {
    adapter.disconnect(handle, 0x13)?; // Remote User Terminated Connection
    adapter.process_events(Some(Duration::from_secs(1)))?;
}
```

### Local Device Configuration

```rust
// Set local device name
adapter.set_local_name("RustyBlue Device")?;

// Get the local address
let addr = adapter.get_local_address()?;
println!("Local address: {}", addr);
```

## Development and Testing

The GAP implementation provides the foundation for device discovery and connection, but requires more comprehensive testing, especially for connection management and security features. Unit tests should be developed to cover:

1. Advertising data parsing
2. Connection parameter validation
3. Event processing
4. Address handling

```bash
cargo test --package rustyblue --lib -- gap::tests
```

## Integration with Other Modules

The GAP module is designed to work closely with other modules:

- **HCI**: GAP uses HCI commands and events for low-level operations
- **GATT**: After establishing connection via GAP, GATT can be used for service interaction
- **SMP**: Security functions should integrate with GAP for secure connections

By implementing the missing features in GAP, the overall Bluetooth stack functionality will be greatly enhanced, particularly for secure connections and advanced device management scenarios.
