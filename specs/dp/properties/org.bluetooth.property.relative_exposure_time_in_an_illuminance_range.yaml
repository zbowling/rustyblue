property:
  identifier: org.bluetooth.property.relative_exposure_time_in_an_illuminance_range
  name: Relative Exposure Time in an Illuminance Range
  group: org.bluetooth.property_group.photometry
  characteristic: org.bluetooth.characteristic.relative_value_in_an_illuminance_range
  description: |-
    This property represents a relative exposure time of a light sensor (typically a photodetector) in an illuminance range.
    The Relative Value field is the relative exposure time, that is, the exposure time within the illuminance interval compared with the total exposure time recorded by the sensor. See the Total Light Exposure Time property in \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.property.total_light_exposure_time}.
    The Minimum Illuminance and Maximum Illuminance define the illuminance range.
    Example use case: To adjust light levels or reduce the hours of display for a particular piece of art in a museum.
  mapping:
    description: This property has three fields, each of which derives its value from the characteristic. These fields are shown in the table below.
