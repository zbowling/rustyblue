  identifier: org.bluetooth.property.light_control_ambient_luxlevel_on
  name: Light Control Ambient LuxLevel On
  group: org.bluetooth.property_group.light_control
  characteristic: org.bluetooth.characteristic.illuminance
  description: |-
    This property represents the minimum ambient illuminance level as measured by a lux sensor that determines if a light or a group of lights transitions from the standby state to a run state. The standby state is a state when the light is switched on and controlled, but operating at minimum level. This minimum level can be zero but can also be set to a low value for security or safety reasons. The run state is a state in which the light is switched on and operating at normal light level.
    This property can be used to avoid lights being on during the day with ample daylight in a space.
