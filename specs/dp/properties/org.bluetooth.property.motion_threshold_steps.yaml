  identifier: org.bluetooth.property.motion_threshold_steps
  name: Motion Threshold Steps
  group: org.bluetooth.property_group.occupancy
  characteristic: org.bluetooth.characteristic.percentage_8_steps
  description: |-
    This property represents the number of steps available when configuring the Motion Threshold property (see \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.property.motion_threshold}).
    Occupancy sensors may have user-configurable sensitivity, represented by the Motion Threshold property. Some sensors may only allow a discrete number of sensitivity steps between 0% and 100%. This property is intended to be defined by device manufacturers and represents the number of steps available when configuring the Motion Threshold property.
    For example:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A value of 1 represents one step available for the configuration of the Motion Threshold: 0% to 100% in one 100% step.
    \item A value of 5 represents five steps available for the configuration of the Motion Threshold: 0% to 100% in five 20% steps.
    \item A value of 200 represents 200 steps available for the configuration of the Motion Threshold: 0% to 100% in 200 0.5% steps.
    \end{itemize}
