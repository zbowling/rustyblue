property:
  identifier: org.bluetooth.property.present_input_ripple_voltage
  name: Present Input Ripple Voltage
  group: org.bluetooth.property_group.electrical_input
  characteristic: org.bluetooth.characteristic.percentage_8
  description: |-
    This property represents the measured relative ripple voltage value. The relative ripple voltage is the ripple voltage value divided by the average voltage (as reported by the Average Input Voltage property in \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.property.average_input_voltage}).
    Example use case: For early detection of power supply failure, identifying whether capacitors in a power supply are starting to fail based on an increase in the ripple voltage.
