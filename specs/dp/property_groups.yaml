- identifier: org.bluetooth.property_group.ambient_temperature
  name: Ambient Temperature
  description: |-
    This category contains the property definitions related to the air temperature surrounding a device.

- identifier: org.bluetooth.property_group.device_operating_temperature
  name: Device Operating Temperature
  description: |-
    This category contains the property definitions related to the operating temperature of a device.
    Example use case: To monitor the temperature of an LED fixture or a refrigerator.

- identifier: org.bluetooth.property_group.electrical_input
  name: Electrical Input
  description: |-
    This category contains the property definitions related to the electrical input of a device such as input voltage and ripple voltage. These properties can be monitored to check whether the device is running at the right input conditions. They also can be used to monitor the performance of the electrical power distribution within a building, or to monitor the performance of the power supplies powering a device.

- identifier: org.bluetooth.property_group.energy_management
  name: Energy Management
  description: |-
    This category contains the property definitions related to the energy management of a device.
    Example use case: To monitor the energy use of devices such as a heater or a light fixture by enabling building information services to report aggregate energy usage, and report high-energy-use devices. Such information could be used to decide which devices to replace with more efficient devices, or to reduce energy usage by reducing the energy-use level or total operating time for high-energy-use devices.

- identifier: org.bluetooth.property_group.environmental
  name: Environmental
  description: |-
    This category contains property definitions related to environment conditions.
    Example use case: To monitor the air quality that surrounds a device.

- identifier: org.bluetooth.property_group.general_device_information
  name: General Device Information
  description: |-
    This category contains property definitions related to general device information such as device appearance, manufacturing data, identification, and spatial location.

- identifier: org.bluetooth.property_group.light_control
  name: Light Control
  description: |-
    This category contains the property definitions related to light control and defines, for example, the light control properties set in the Lighting Control Model in the Mesh Model specification \RefRef{msh_mdl}.

- identifier: org.bluetooth.property_group.lighting
  name: Lighting
  description: |-
    This category contains the property definitions related to general lighting, light sources, and light fixtures. It does not define properties related to light control (see Light Control (\autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.property_group.light_control}), Light LC for these properties). It also does not define properties related to detection of light (see Photometry (\autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.property_group.photometry}) for these).

- identifier: org.bluetooth.property_group.occupancy
  name: Occupancy
  description: |-
    This category contains the property definitions related to occupancy of spaces. The occupancy properties are related to people, but also to cars (in parking garages), animals (on farms), and units within a building (e.g., rental units or hotel rooms).

- identifier: org.bluetooth.property_group.photometry
  name: Photometry
  description: |-
    This category contains the property definitions related to photometrics. These typically are measured with photodetectors.

- identifier: org.bluetooth.property_group.power_supply_output
  name: Power Supply Output
  description: |-
    This section contains the property definitions related to the electrical output of a power supply, also known as an LED driver, such as output voltage, output ripple voltage, and output current. These properties can be used to monitor the driver operating conditions and electrical operating history for light sources connected to the driver, such as LED arrays.

- identifier: org.bluetooth.property_group.warranty_and_service
  name: Warranty and Service
  description: |-
    This category contains the property definitions related to warranty and service of a device, for example, the total runtime of a device and the warranty runtime as provided by the manufacturer.
    The device properties in this category can be used to check whether or not the device is still covered by a runtime warranty and to track aspects of device usage for a runtime warranty.

- identifier: org.bluetooth.property_group.luminaire
  name: Luminaire
  description: |-
    This category contains the property definitions related to luminaires.

- identifier: org.bluetooth.property_group.settings
  name: Settings
  description: |-
    This category contains the property definitions related to the various device settings.
