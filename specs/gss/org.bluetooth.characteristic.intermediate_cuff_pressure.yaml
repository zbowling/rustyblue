  identifier: org.bluetooth.characteristic.intermediate_cuff_pressure
  name: Intermediate Cuff Pressure
  description: |-
    The Intermediate Cuff Pressure characteristic is used to send intermediate Cuff Pressure values to a device for display purposes while a measurement is in progress. The Intermediate Cuff Pressure characteristic has the same format as the Blood Pressure Measurement characteristic in \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.blood_pressure_measurement}. However, due to a different context, the Blood Pressure Measurement Compound Value field is used for the Intermediate Cuff Pressure Compound Value field and the Systolic sub-field is used for the Current Cuff Pressure sub-field. The Diastolic and Mean Arterial Pressure fields are unused.
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
