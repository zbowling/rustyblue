    The Heart Rate Measurement characteristic is used to represent data related to a heart rate measurement.
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
  structure:
    - field: Flags
      type: boolean[8]
      size: "1"
      description: See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.heart_rate_measurement/field/flags}

        Present if bit 3 of Flags field is set to 1
    - field: RR-interval
      type: uint16[n]
      size: 0 or n*2
      description: |-
        See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.heart_rate_measurement/field/rr-interval}

            Heart Rate Value Format:
            0 = Heart Rate Value Format is set to uint8
            1 = Heart Rate Value Format is set to uint16

        - bit: "2"
          description: Sensor Contact Supported
        - bit: "3"
          description: Energy Expended present
        - bit: "4"
          description: RR-Interval present
        - bit: 5–7
          description: Reserved for Future Use
    - name: RR-Interval
      description: |-
        The RR-Interval value represents the time between two R-Wave detections. Each RR-Interval value is represented by a uint16 with 1/1024 second as the unit. Because it is possible to measure several RR-Intervals between transmissions of the Heart Rate Measurement characteristic, multiple RR-Interval sub-fields can be present in the characteristic. The number of RR-Interval sub-fields present is determined by a combination of the overall length of the characteristic and whether or not the characteristic contains the Energy Expended field.
        Where there are multiple RR-Interval values transmitted in the Heart Rate Measurement characteristic, the structure of this field is defined below.
