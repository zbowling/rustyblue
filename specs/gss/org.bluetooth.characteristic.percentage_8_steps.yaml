  description: |-
    The Percentage 8 Steps characteristic is used to represent a number of steps between 0% and 100% when configuring a Percentage 8 characteristic value (see \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.percentage_8}).
    For example:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A value of 1 represents one step: 0% to 100% in one 100% step.
    \item A value of 5 represents five steps: 0% to 100% in five 20% steps.
    \item A value of 200 represents 200 steps: 0% to 100% in 200 0.5% steps.
    \end{itemize}
  structure:

        Unit is the number of steps from the minimum to the maximum value.
        Minimum: 1
        Maximum: 200
        Represented values: M = 1, d = 0, b = 0
        Unit: org.bluetooth.unit.unitless
        A value of 0xFF represents "value is not known".
        All other values are Prohibited.
