    The Battery Level Status characteristic is used to represent the power state of a battery, an identifier used to identify the specific battery associated with the data, and the battery level.
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
  structure:
    - field: Flags
      type: boolean[8]
      size: "1"
      description: See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.battery_level_status/field/flags}.
