  identifier: org.bluetooth.characteristic.chromatic_distance_from_planckian
  name: Chromatic Distance from Planckian
  description: |-
    The Chromatic Distance from Planckian characteristic is used to represent a distance of a chromaticity coordinate from the Planckian locus in the (u′, 2/3v′) diagram as defined by ANSI standard C78.377-2008 \RefRef{ansi_anslg_c78}.
    The distance is positive if the chromaticity coordinate is located above the Planckian locus (i.e., has a higher y value than the Planckian), and negative if it is located below.
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
  structure:
    - field: Distance from Planckian
      type: sint16
      size: "2"
      description: |-
        Unit is unitless with a resolution of 0.00001.
        Minimum: -0.05
        Maximum: 0.05
        Represented values: M = 1, d = -5, b = 0
        A value of 0x7FFF represents "value is not valid".
        A value of 0x7FFE represents "value is not known".
        All other values are prohibited.
