  identifier: org.bluetooth.characteristic.intermediate_temperature
  name: Intermediate Temperature
  description: |-
    The Intermediate Temperature characteristic is used to send intermediate temperature values to a device for display purposes while a measurement is in progress. The Intermediate Temperature characteristic has the same format as the Temperature Measurement characteristic in \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.temperature_measurement} except that, due to a different context, the Measurement Value field is referred to as the Intermediate Temperature field.
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
  structure:
    - field: Flags
      type: boolean[8]
      size: "1"
      description: See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.intermediate_temperature/field/flags}.
    - field: Intermediate Temperature (Celsius)
      type: medfloat32
      size: 0 or 4
      description: |-
        This field contains a measurement value.
        Unit: org.bluetooth.unit.thermodynamic_temperature.degree_celsius.
        Present if bit 0 of Flags field is set to 0
    - field: Intermediate Temperature (Fahrenheit)
      type: medfloat32
      size: 0 or 4
      description: |-
        This field contains a measurement value.
        Unit: org.bluetooth.unit.thermodynamic_temperature.degree_fahrenheit.
        Present if bit 0 of Flags field is set to 1
    - field: Time Stamp
      type: struct
      size: 0 or 7
      description: |-
        Refer to Date Time characteristic in \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.date_time}.
        Present if bit 1 of Flags field is set to 1
    - field: Temperature Type
      type: uint8
      size: 0 or 1
      description: |-
        The format of this field is the same as the format of the Temperature Type characteristic in \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.temperature_type}.
        Present if bit 2 of Flags field is set to 1
  fields:
    - name: Flags
      description: The bits of this field are defined below.
      values:
        - bit: "0"
          description: |-
            Temperature Units Flag
            0 = Intermediate Temperature in units of Celsius
            1 = Intermediate Temperature in units of Fahrenheit
        - bit: "1"
          description: |-
            Time Stamp Flag
            0 = Time Stamp field not present
            1 = Time Stamp field present
        - bit: "2"
          description: |-
            Temperature Type Flag
            0 = Temperature Type field not present
            1 = Temperature Type field present
        - bit: 3–7
