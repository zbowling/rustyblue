  identifier: org.bluetooth.characteristic.enhanced_intermediate_cuff_pressure
  name: Enhanced Intermediate Cuff Pressure
  description: |-
    The Enhanced Intermediate Cuff Pressure characteristic is used to represent enhanced intermediate Cuff Pressure values for display purposes while a measurement is in progress and includes a UTC time stamp and a user facing time.
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
  structure:
    - field: Flags
      type: boolean[8]
      size: "1"
      description: See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.enhanced_intermediate_cuff_pressure/field/flags}.
    - field: Intermediate Cuff Pressure Value
      type: medfloat16
      size: "2"
