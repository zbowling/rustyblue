            Represented values: M = 1, d = 0, b = -10
            Unit is 1/1024 second
    - name: First Crank Measurement Angle
      description: When observed with the front wheel to the right of the pedals, a value of 0 degrees represents the angle when the crank is in the 12 o'clock position and a value of 90 degrees represents the angle, measured clockwise, when the crank points towards the front wheel in a 3 o'clock position. The left crank sensor (if fitted) detects the 0° when the crank it is attached to is in the 12 o'clock position and the right sensor (if fitted) detects the 0° when the crank it is attached to is in its 12 o'clock position; thus, there is a constant 180° difference between the right crank and the left crank position signals.
