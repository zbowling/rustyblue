  identifier: org.bluetooth.characteristic.high_intensity_exercise_threshold
  name: High Intensity Exercise Threshold
  description: |-
    The High Intensity Exercise Threshold characteristic is used to represent the high intensity exercise threshold of a user.
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
  structure:
    - field: Field Selector
      type: uint8
      size: "1"
      description: See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.high_intensity_exercise_threshold/field/field_selector}
    - field: Threshold as Energy Expenditure per Hour
      type: uint16
      size: 0 or 2
      description: |-
        Base Unit: org.bluetooth.unit.energy.joule
        Represented values: M = 1, d = 3, b = 0
        Unit is joule with a resolution of 1000 joules
        Present if value of Field Selector field is 1
    - field: Threshold as Metabolic Equivalent
      type: uint8
      size: 0 or 1
      description: |-
        Base Unit: org.bluetooth.unit.metabolic_equivalent
        Represented values: M = 1, d = -1, b = 0
        Unit is MET with a resolution of 0.1 MET (i.e., kcal/kg/hour)
        Present if value of Field Selector field is 2
    - field: Threshold as Percentage of Maximum Heart Rate
      type: uint8
      size: 0 or 1
      description: |-
        Unit: org.bluetooth.unit.percentage
        Present if value of Field Selector field is 3
    - field: Threshold as Heart Rate
      type: uint8
      size: 0 or 1
      description: |-
        Unit: org.bluetooth.unit.period.beats_per_minute
        Present if value of Field Selector field is 4
  fields:
    - name: Field Selector
      description: |-
        The Field Selector field determines the High Intensity Exercise Threshold characteristic field selected to express the high intensity threshold. The selected field is present in the High Intensity Exercise Threshold characteristic, whereas the remaining fields are not present.
        The values of this field are defined below.
      values:
        - value: "0"
          description: No field is selected
        - value: "1"
          description: The Threshold as Energy Expenditure per Hour field is selected
        - value: "2"
          description: The Threshold as Metabolic Equivalent field is selected
        - value: "3"
          description: The Threshold as Percentage of Maximum Heart Rate field is selected
        - value: "4"
          description: The Threshold as Heart Rate field is selected
        - value: 5–255
