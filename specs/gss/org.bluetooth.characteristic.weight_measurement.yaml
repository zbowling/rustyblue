  identifier: org.bluetooth.characteristic.weight_measurement
  name: Weight Measurement
  description: |-
    The Weight Measurement characteristic is used to represent data related to a weight measurement.
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
  structure:
    - field: Flags
      type: boolean[8]
      size: "1"
      description: See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.weight_measurement/field/flags}
    - field: Weight
      type: uint16
      size: "2"
      description: This field is in kilograms with resolution 0.005 if the bit 0 of the Flag field is 0 or in pounds with a resolution of 0.01 if the bit 0 of the Flag field is 1.
    - field: Time Stamp
      type: struct
      size: 0 or 7
      description: |-
        Refer to Date Time characteristic in \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.date_time}
        Present if bit 1 of Flags field is set to 1
    - field: User ID
      type: uint8
      size: 0 or 1
      description: |-
        The special value of 0xFF for User ID represents "unknown user".
        Present if bit 2 of Flags field is set to 1
    - field: BMI
      type: uint16
      size: 0 or 2
      description: |-
        Unit is 0.1 kg/m2 or org.bluetooth.unit.kilogram_per_square_metre
        Represented values: M = 1, d = -1, b = 0.
        Present if bit 3 of Flags field is set to 1
    - field: Height
      type: uint16
      size: 0 or 2
      description: |-
        This field is in meters with a resolution of 0.001 if the bit 0 of the Flag field is 0 or in inches with a resolution of 0.1 if the bit 0 of the Flag field is 1.
        Present if bit 3 of Flags field is set to 1
  fields:
    - name: Flags
      description: The bits of this field are defined below.
      values:
        - bit: "0"
          description: |-
            Measurement Units:
            0 = SI (Weight and Mass in units of kilogram (kg) and Height in units of meter)
            1 = Imperial (Weight and Mass in units of pound (lb) and Height in units of inch (in))
        - bit: "1"
          description: Time Stamp present
        - bit: "2"
          description: User ID present
