  identifier: org.bluetooth.characteristic.battery_health_status
  name: Battery Health Status
  description: |-
    The Battery Health Status characteristic is used to represent several aspects of battery health.
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
  structure:
    - field: Flags
      type: boolean[8]
      size: "1"
      description: See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.battery_health_status/field/flags}.
    - field: Battery Health Summary
      type: uint8
      size: 0 or 1
      description: |-
        Represents aggregation of the overall health of the battery where 100% represents new working condition and 0% represents the end of its expected lifetime when replacement is required. The value within this range is determined by the implementation.
        Unit is percentage with a resolution of 1.
        Allowed range is 0 to 100.
        Base unit: org.bluetooth.unit.percentage
        Present if bit 0 of the Flags field is set to 1
    - field: Cycle Count
      type: uint16
      size: 0 or 2
      description: |-
        Represents the count value of charge cycles where one charge cycle is a discharge equivalent to the capacity of the battery at full charge in its current condition.
        Unit is unitless with a resolution of 1.
        Present if bit 1 of the Flags field is set to 1
    - field: Current Temperature
      type: sint8
      size: 0 or 1
      description: |-
        Represents the current temperature of the battery.
        Base Unit: org.bluetooth.unit.thermodynamic_temperature.degree_celsius
        A raw value of 0x7F represents: Greater than 126.
        A raw value of 0x80 represents: Less than -127.
        Present if bit 2 of the Flags field is set to 1
    - field: Deep Discharge Count
      type: uint16
      size: 0 or 2
      description: |-
        Represents the number of times the battery was completely discharged.
        Unit is unitless with a resolution of 1.
        Present if bit 3 of the Flags field is set to 1
  fields:
    - name: Flags
      description: The values of this field are defined below.
      values:
        - bit: "0"
          description: Battery Health Summary Present
        - bit: "1"
          description: Cycle Count Present
        - bit: "2"
          description: Current Temperature Present
        - bit: "3"
          description: Deep Discharge Count Present
        - bit: 4–7
          description: RFU
