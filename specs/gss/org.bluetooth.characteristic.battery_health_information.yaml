  identifier: org.bluetooth.characteristic.battery_health_information
  name: Battery Health Information
  description: |-
    The Battery Health Information characteristic is used to represent the health of a battery.
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
  structure:
    - field: Flags
      type: boolean[8]
      size: "1"
      description: See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.battery_health_information/field/flags}.
    - field: Cycle Count Designed Lifetime
      type: uint16
      size: 0 or 2
      description: |-
        Represents the designed number of charge cycles supported by the device where one charge cycle is a discharge equivalent to the capacity of the battery at full charge in its current condition.
        Unit is unitless with a resolution of 1.
        Present if bit 0 of the Flags field is set to 1
    - field: Min Designed Operating Temperature
      type: sint8
      size: 0 or 1
      description: |-
        Represents the minimum designed operating temperature of the battery.
        Base Unit: org.bluetooth.unit.thermodynamic_temperature.degree_celsius
        A raw value of 0x7F represents: Greater than 126.
        A raw value of 0x80 represents: Less than -127.
        Present if bit 1 of the Flags field is set to 1
    - field: Max Designed Operating Temperature
      type: sint8
      size: 0 or 1
      description: |-
        Represents the maximum designed operating temperature of the battery.
        Base Unit: org.bluetooth.unit.thermodynamic_temperature.degree_celsius
        A raw value of 0x7F represents: Greater than 126.
        A raw value of 0x80 represents: Less than -127.
        Present if bit 1 of the Flags field is set to 1
  fields:
    - name: Flags
      description: The values of this field are defined below.
      values:
        - bit: "0"
          description: Cycle Count Designed Lifetime Present
        - bit: "1"
          description: Min and Max Designed Operating Temperature Present
        - bit: 2–7
          description: RFU
