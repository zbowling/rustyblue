  identifier: org.bluetooth.characteristic.blood_pressure_record
  name: Blood Pressure Record
  description: |-
    The Blood Pressure Record characteristic is a container that represents a stored value of a blood pressure measurement or of any other characteristic as specified by the service using the characteristic.
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
  structure:
    - field: Segmentation Header
      type: boolean[8]
      size: "1"
      description: See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.blood_pressure_record/field/segmentation_header}.
    - field: Sequence Number
      type: uint16
      size: "2"
      description: |-
        Contains a sequence number of the record. The sequence number starts at 0 and loops back to 0 after 65536 records (per user).
        See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.blood_pressure_record/field/sequence_number}.
    - field: UUID
      type: uint16
      size: "2"
      description: |-
        Contains the UUID of the contained characteristic value.
        See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.blood_pressure_record/field/uuid}.
    - field: Recorded Characteristic
      type: Determined by UUID
      size: Variable
      description: |-
        Contains a part of or a complete characteristic value.
        See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.blood_pressure_record/field/recorded_characteristic}.
    - field: E2E-CRC
      type: uint16
      size: 0 or 2
      description: |-
        Contains the CRC over all the data of a complete single or multi-message record.
        See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.blood_pressure_record/field/e2e-crc}.
        The presence of this field is defined by the service using this characteristic.
  fields:
    - name: Segmentation Header
      description: |-
        The Segmentation Header field provides information about which segments to concatenate to get a complete Blood Pressure Record value.
        The bits of this field are defined below.
      values:
        - bit: "0"
          description: |-
            First Segment: the characteristic contains the first segment of a record
            0 = False
            1 = True
        - bit: "1"
          description: |-
            Last Segment: The characteristic contains the last segment of a record
            0 = False
            1 = True
        - bit: 2–7
          description: |-
            Rolling Segment Counter: 0 to 63
            If the Rolling Segment Counter is equal to 63, it rolls over to 0 when it is next incremented.
    - name: Sequence Number
      description: The sequence number field contains the sequence number of a record. The sequence number starts at 0 and loops back to 0 after 65536 records and is used to number a sequence of records as defined by the service.
    - name: UUID
      description: The UUID field contains the 16-bit Bluetooth SIG assigned number for a Bluetooth SIG defined characteristic. Supported values are typically constrained by the service. See \RefRef{assigned_numbers} for the list of SIG Assigned Numbers for GATT characteristic UUIDs.
    - name: Recorded Characteristic
      description: The Recorded Characteristic field contains a partial or a complete characteristic value. The characteristic value is identified by the UUID field. For most UUID values, the definition of the corresponding characteristic value is included in this document.
    - name: E2E-CRC
      description: If the service using the Blood Pressure Record characteristic supports E2E-CRC, the status of the recorded characteristic is secured by a CRC calculated over all fields of all parts of a multi-message record not including the E2E-CRC-field itself. See \autoref{sec:crc_calculation} for further information about the CRC calculation.
