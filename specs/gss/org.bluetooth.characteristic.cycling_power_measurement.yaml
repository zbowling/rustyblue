      description: |-
        When observed with the front wheel to the right of the pedals, a value of 0 degrees represents the angle when the crank is in the 12 o'clock position and a value of 90 degrees represents the angle, measured clockwise, when the crank points towards the front wheel in the 3 o'clock position. The left crank sensor (if fitted) detects 0 degrees when the crank it is attached to is in the 12 o'clock position, and the right sensor (if fitted) detects 0 degrees when the crank it is attached to is in the 12 o'clock position; thus, there is a constant 180-degree difference between the right crank and the left crank position signals.
        When present, both subfields "Extreme Angles - Minimum Angle" and "Extreme Angles - Maximum Angle" are always present as a pair and are concatenated into a uint24 value (3 octets). As an example, if the Maximum Angle is 0xABC and the Minimum Angle is 0x123, the field value is represented as 0x123ABC.
        The structure of this field is defined below.
