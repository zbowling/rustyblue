        This field represents the Sensor time in seconds since the epoch start time. The epoch start is on January 1 of 1900, or 2000 at 00:00:00, depending on the value of the Epoch Start 2000 Flag.
        When both the Time Stamp field and the User Facing Time field are present, the Time Stamp field represents the base time (possibly UTC aligned) and does not take into account time zone, DST adjustments or manual adjustments of the time displayed to a user.
    - name: User Facing Time
      description: |-
        This field represents the user facing time in seconds since the epoch start time. The epoch start is on January 1 of 1900, or 2000 at 00:00:00, depending on the value of the Epoch Start 2000 Flag.
        User facing time takes into account time zone, DST adjustments and manual adjustments of the time displayed to a user.
