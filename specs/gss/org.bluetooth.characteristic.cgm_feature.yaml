    The CGM Feature characteristic is used to represent the supported features of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM).
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
  structure:
    - field: CGM Feature
      type: boolean[24]
      size: "3"
      description: See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.cgm_feature/field/cgm_feature}
    - field: CGM Type-Sample Location
      type: struct
      size: "1"
      description: See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.cgm_feature/field/cgm_type-sample_location}
    - field: E2E-CRC
