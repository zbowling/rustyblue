  identifier: org.bluetooth.characteristic.sulfur_dioxide_concentration
  name: Sulfur Dioxide Concentration
  description: |-
    The Sulfur Dioxide Concentration characteristic is used to represent a measure of sulfur dioxide (SO\textsubscript{2}) concentration.
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
  structure:
    - field: Sulfur Dioxide Concentration

        Base Unit: org.bluetooth.unit.density.kilogram_per_cubic_meter
        The special value NRes is used to report a value outside the available range and resolution, possibly resulting from an overflow or underflow situation.
        The special value NaN is used to report an invalid result from a computation step or to indicate missing data due to the hardware’s inability to provide a valid measurement, perhaps from sensor perturbation.
