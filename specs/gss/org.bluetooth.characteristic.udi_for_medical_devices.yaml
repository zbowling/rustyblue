characteristic:
  identifier: org.bluetooth.characteristic.udi_for_medical_devices
  name: UDI for Medical Devices
  description: |-
    This characteristic is used to represent a unique identification assigned to a medical device and the controlling and assigning bodies.
    A Unique Device Identifier (UDI) is a string that is used to label a medical product in a pre-defined way as defined by a regional authority such as the US FDA. A UDI is linked to a registration of product information in a database and tracks a device in case of medical issues linked to using the device. A UDI consists of a Device Information (DI) part that identifies the device type and a Production Information (PI) part that identifies a specific device instance by the device’s production date, serial number, and similar attributes. The UDI for Medical Devices characteristic contains the full UDI or at least the DI part (see \RefRef{UDI_system} for more information).
    The UDI Issuer and the UDI Authority fields contain international Object Identifiers (OIDs) as defined by ITU-T \RefRef{OIDS_ITUT_X600} and ISO/IEC \RefRef{OIDS_ISOIEC_9341}. For example, the OID for the US FDA is 2.16.840.1.113883.3.24. Details on an OID are retrievable via directories such as \url{http://www.oid-info.com/}.
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
  structure:
    - field: Flags
      type: boolean[8]
      size: "1"

    - field: UDI Label
      type: utf8s
      size: "variable"
      description: |-
        String value matching the UDI in human readable form as assigned to the product by a recognized UDI Issuer. Zero-terminated.
