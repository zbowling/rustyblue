characteristic:
  identifier: org.bluetooth.characteristic.elapsed_time
  name: Elapsed Time
  description: |-
    The Elapsed Time characteristic is used to represent the current time of a clock or tick counter at the time an event occurred. The Time Value allows easy calculation of time differences and easy comparison of times. The characteristic is a fixed-size structure that provides sufficient information to interpret the reported time in many contexts.
    \newpage
    The flags determine if the Time Value represents a tick counter, UTC time or local time. The following formula gives the relation between local time and UTC time{{:}}
    \hspace{1cm} \textit{Local time} = \textit{UTC time} + \textit{TZ/DST Offset} * \textit{15 minutes}
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
  structure:
    - field: Flags
      type: boolean[8]
      size: "1"
      description: |-
        See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.elapsed_time/field/flags}.
    - field: Time Value
      type: uint48
      size: "6"
      description: |-
        The actual time value in the resolution as defined by the flags.
        The Time Value field contains a counter of the number of time units as determined by the time resolution of the clock. The starting point of the timeline is 2000-01-01 00:00:00 when reporting a time of day or is implementation-dependent for a tick counter.
    - field: Time Sync Source Type
      type: uint8
      size: "1"
      description: |-
        The type of time source used for synchronization. See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.time_source} for the supported values.
        This field has no meaning for a tick counter.
    - field: TZ/DST Offset
      type: sint8
      size: "1"
      description: |-
        Combined TZ/DST offset from UTC in 15-minute units.
        This field has no meaning for a tick counter and is relevant only when the TZ/DST offset used flag is set.
  fields:
    - name: Flags
      description: The bits of this field are defined below.
      values:
        - bit: "0"
          description: |-
            Time is a tick counter
            0 = Time Value reports a time of day
            1 = Time Value reports a counter (also known as "relative time")
        - bit: "1"
          description: |-
            Time is UTC
            0 = Time Value reports local time
            1 = Time Value reports UTC 
            This field has no meaning for a tick counter.
        - bit: "2-3"
          description: |-
            Time resolution
            00 = 1 second
            01 = 100 milliseconds
            10 = 1 millisecond
            11 = 100 microseconds
        - bit: "4"
          description: |-
            TZ/DST offset is used
            0 = TZ/DST offset is not used 
            1 = TZ/DST offset is used
            This field has no meaning for a tick counter.
        - bit: "5"
          description: |-
            Time stamp is from the current timeline
            0 = Time stamp is not from the current timeline
            1 = Time stamp is from the current timeline
            This bit indicates if the time comes from the current timeline as reported by the clock that is used for keeping track of time.
